Hey!  
My name is Chloe from the United States! I have a constant drive to learn more, so I often spend my time learning as much about programming as possible. I enjoy using languages such as C++, Python, and Rust, though Rust is my favorite. If you like my projects, also check out my YouTube and maybe consider subscribing as it helps me out and it's free <3

### Skills:
Python, Rust, C++, HTML, CSS
