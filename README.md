Hey!
My name is Chloe from the United States! I have a constant drive to learn more, so I often spend my time learning as much about programing as possible. I enjoy using languages such as Python, Rust and C++ in my projects. I also enjoy working on Websites, Web browsers
and design. I am a full-stack programmer so I do everything in a project myself <3
