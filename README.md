Hey!
My name is Chloe from the United States! I have a constant drive to learn more, so I often spend my time learning as much about programing as possible. I enjoy using lanuages such as c++, python and rust, though rust is my favroite. If you like my projects, also check out my YouTube and maybe consider subsribing as it helps me out and its free <3
